## Video Walkthrough
Because my app has sound, I recorded using Zoom instead of Loom (since Loom only records system sound inside a browser tab).

## App Brainstorming

"Make a list of your favorite 3-5 applications and identify 2-3 features that make them your favorite app. It's okay if features repeat on different apps."

### Some of my Favorite Apps and Features

*Focus Friend*

• The UI/art style

• Customization features

• Game-like theme helps me stay focused

*Notion*

• Helps me stay organized with simple UI

• Variety of templates & community support

*Pinterest*

• Accurate recommendation algorithm

• Simple UI

### App Idea
"Think of an app idea that you would like to build. It can be a new idea or an improvement on an existing app. Write a short paragraph describing the app and the features you would like to implement."

I want to make a Coffee Shop app with a built-in inventory system. The app would allow shop owners to customize their menu, use it as a POS system, have customers place online orders, keep track of sales, and receive notifications when inventory is low. The app would function as an all-in-one hub for coffee shop needs while reducing waste with a smart inventory tracker. Data visualizations and customer reviews features would help owners understand the business needs and customer satisfaction levels.

## Challenges
For this project, clicking the button to change the background color made me think of flashing lights at a party. It was tricky understanding where to find tools on XCode, but I slowly got the hang of it. After some Google searches and jam sessions, I put my favorite song over it and added a play button.

It's disco time!
