## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

Clicking the button to change the background color made me think of flashing lights at a party.

It was tricky understanding where to find tools on XCode, but I slowly got the hang of it.

After some Google searches and jam sessions, I put my favorite song over it and added a play button.

It's disco time!
